Description

Enhancement of ABC Companys’ App or website to include new feature called ABC Pantry

Current State

 

Overview and Summary

ABC Company is the world’s leading online e-commerce company. They started by selling books and now have a presence across the world selling more than 6 million items globally.

Most of the products that dominate ABC Company’s sales are non-essential products like fashion products, electronic gadgets, mobile phones, beauty products, books and home furnishings. But ABC Company has realized that every household will need daily essential products like cereals, snacks, beverages, cleaning products, grooming products and so on. ABC Company is seeing a huge market globally in Daily Essential Products and wants to venture into this side of business.

ABC Company decided to create a new feature known as ABC Pantry which would sell daily essential products. This would be an additional enhancement in the current website/app. This would be ABC Company’s foray into daily essential products which are regular consumption products and would lead to repeat sales every month.

ABC Company has invited Business Analysts trained at Simplilearn to capture the requirements for the creating this software.

 

Future State

ABC Company has given them the following requirements:

Existing system should have a new feature called ABC Pantry

On clicking this feature, it would open up a new range and categories of products.

This feature should be at a prominent visible area of the existing website or app.

There should be a logical grouping of products for customers to search for daily essential items they wish to buy. The following categories should be included:

Flour and rice

Sugar, salt, and spices

Pulses

Personal care

Snacks

Hand wash and sanitizers

Household cleaning essentials

Breakfast food items

Tea and coffee

Baby care

Female hygiene

Tissues and fresheners

ABC Pantry should be able to show five advertisements to earn the advertising revenues. These advertisements should not be too intrusive to spoil the customer interaction with ABC Pantry.

ABC Pantry should have a feature to show certain offers that are created for customers. They have found that many customers tend to buy products under the offers laid out by them.

Customers should be able to add these items to their shopping cart. This cart may have items from ABC company’s nonessential products as well.

The software should not allow the user to place an order of an amount less than 30 USD. Individual items can be less than 30 USD but the total order price has to exceed 30 USD.

Free Delivery will be offered only if the total order exceeds 50 USD.

Currently ABC Pantry would have a presence only in certain cities that are mentioned in the data sets.

In the US Market, ABC Company has categorized cities into 4 zones based on their sales in that city. Cities falling under zone 1 have the highest sales. The sales in various zones are zone 1 > zone 2 > zone 3 > zone 4

Management wants certain reports at the end of the day. Please give the report formats for the following reports:

Total sales for each day

Total sales for each product category as mentioned in point four.

Total sales across USA

Total sales for each city.

Total sales for each zone that city falls into (that is, zone 1, 2, 3, and 4)

Identify best-selling categories

Identify the worst-selling categories
